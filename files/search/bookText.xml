                                          My parents immigrated to the United States from Poland and learned English as a
                                      second language as adults. My sisters and I were born in the United States. My parents
                                      spoke Yiddish to us; we answered in English. In that process, my parents’ English improved
                                      immeasurably. Such is the case with many immigrant parents whose children are fluent
                                      in English. They usually learn English much faster than others; they hear the language in
                                      natural ways, in the context of daily life.
                                          Learning a language in context, whether it be from the home, from work, or from a
                                      textbook, cannot be overestimated. The challenge for me has been to find a variety of
                                      high-interest topics to engage the adult language learner. I was thrilled to work on this new
                                      edition of Grammar in Context for National Geographic Learning. In so doing, I have been
                                      able to combine exciting new readings with captivating photos to exemplify the grammar.
                                          I have given more than 100 workshops at ESL programs and professional conferences
                                      around the United States, where I have gotten feedback from users of previous editions
                                      of Grammar in Context. Some teachers have expressed concern about trying to cover long
                                      grammar units within a limited time. While ESL is not taught in a uniform number of hours
                                      per week, I have heeded my audiences and streamlined the series so that the grammar and
                                      practice covered is more manageable. And in response to the needs of most ESL programs,
                                      I have expanded and enriched the writing component.
                                          Whether you are a new user of Grammar in Context or have used this series before, I

               1.       Timothy Doner is able to communicate in over 20 languages.
               2.       He doesn’t practice with native speakers.

               3.       It’s impossible for him to practice with native speakers in other countries.

              THINK ABOUT IT  Discuss the questions with a partner or in a small group.

               1.  Do you believe that some people learn languages more easily than others? Explain.
               2.  What are some ways that learning a language can help you better connect with the speakers of that language?

               EXAMPLES                                          EXPLANATION
               I like English.                                   We use the base form of the verb with I, you, we, they,
               You know Mandarin.                                and plural subjects.
               We come from China.
               The people of Iran speak Farsi.                   Note: People is plural.
               Timothy lives in New York.                        We use the -s form with he, she, it, and singular subjects.
               He studies languages.


               Every language shows something about the culture.  We use the -s form with subjects beginning with every
               No one in this class speaks Ojibwe.               and no.


               Timothy’s family lives in New York.               Note: Family is singular.
               Timothy likes to learn languages.                 We can follow many main verbs with an infinitive.
               Notice these seven patterns with the base form:
               AffirmAtive StAtement:           You speak Urdu.
               negAtive StAtement:              You don’t speak Hindi.
               Yes/No QueStion:                 Do you speak Farsi?
               Short AnSwer:                    Yes, I do.

               Subject QueStion:                How many people speak Hindi?

               Notice these seven patterns with the -s form:
               AffirmAtive StAtement:           Timothy studies Farsi.

               Subject QueStion:                Who studies Spanish?

               1.  Have has an irregular -s form:
                     I have a language dictionary. Timothy has many language dictionaries.
               2.  The -s form of go is goes. The pronunciation is /go z/.

               3.  The -s form of do is does. The pronunciation is /d ^ z/.
                     You do your homework at home. She does her homework at the library.




                GRAMMAR IN USE
                A common error is to drop the helping verb do/does when asking about meaning, spelling, cost, and time. We use
                regular word order in these situations.

                   What  does “challenge” mean?            How much does the book cost?
                   How  do you spell “challenge”?          How long does it take to learn another language?

                 Action and Nonaction Verbs


           EXAMPLES                                        EXPLANATION

                                                           referring to the exact moment. See Appendix B for a list of
                                                           nonaction verbs.
           I am listening to a podcast.                    Listen is an action verb.
           I hear some unusual sounds.                     Hear is a nonaction verb.
           We are looking at a video.                      Look is an action verb.
           We see Timothy in a taxi.                       See is a nonaction verb.

           My mom is having a hard time with English.      Have is an action verb when it means experience.

           I am looking at the video.                      Some verbs can describe either a sense perception or an
                                                           action: look, smell, taste, sound, feel.
           You look very interested in that video.         When these verbs describe a sense perception, an adjective
           Timothy Doner looks like an average guy.        or the word like usually follows.

           Notes:
           1.  Some common nonaction verbs are:
              •  Sense perception verbs: smell, taste, feel, look, sound, appear
              •   Feelings and desires: like, dislike, love, hate, hope, want, need, prefer, agree, disagree,
                care (about), expect, matter
              •   Mental states: believe, know, hear, see, notice, understand, remember, think (that), suppose, recognize
              •  Others: mean, cost, spell, weigh
           2.  Native speakers sometimes use hope, understand, and think as action verbs.
                  I’m hoping I can visit Vietnam one day.
                  If I’m understanding you correctly, you’re afraid of making a mistake.
                    I’m thinking that I need to practice English more. (This use of the present continuous often
                  means I’m beginning to think . . . )





            GRAMMAR IN USE
            The verb see can mean have a relationship with (personal or professional). In this case, see is an action verb and can
            be present continuous.

                I’m seeing someone new. (dating)
                I’m seeing a new doctor. (visiting as a patient)

               1.   Does learning about the behavior and intelligence of animals such as the chimpanzee, Washoe, change your
                 feelings about them or other animals? Explain.
               2.   What are some characteristics of an animal’s behavior and/or appearance that make you like them or
                 dislike them?

           WE USE THE SIMPLE PRESENT:
           With facts, general truths, habits,   Timothy Doner speaks many languages.
           customs                           Most Americans and Canadians speak English.
                                             Mandarin is the official language of China.
           With a place of origin            Timothy Doner is from New York.

           With nonaction verbs              I think that animal language studies are interesting.
                                             Now I know more about animal communication.

           With a trend                      People are using abbreviations more and more to communicate.
                                             Letter writing is becoming a less popular means of communication.
           With a descriptive state          Timothy Doner is wearing jeans in this video.
                                             He is riding in a taxi.

           PART 1  Editing Advice

             1.  Use the correct question formation.
                          is he         did Washoe die       does “enduring” mean?
                     What he is saying?   When Washoe died?   What means “enduring”?
             2.  Don’t use the present continuous with nonaction verbs.
                               know
                     Now you are knowing a lot about communication.
             3.  Don’t use the future after a time word or if.

                     When I will go back to China, I’m going to be an English teacher.

                     I’ll learn a lot of slang if I will have an English-speaking roommate next semester.

             6.  Don’t forget was or were with born.

                     Washoe  born in Africa.    Where did her babies born?
             7.  Use the base form after do, does, or did.
                                         like
                     At first, Washoe didn’t liked other chimps.   Does Timothy speaks French?
             8.  Use the –s form after he, she, it, or a singular subject in the simple present.
                       wants
                     She want to learn American Sign Language.

             9.  Use the base form after to.

             10.  Pay special attention to irregular verbs in the past.

               1.       Scientists have begun to study risk taking in animals because they are more interesting than humans.
               2.       Lee Dugatkin has studied risk-taking behavior in birds.

               3.       Research has shown that teenagers take more risks if they are with friends.

              THINK ABOUT IT  Discuss the questions with a partner or in a small group.

               1.   How did you answer the question about swimming toward a bigger island in the first paragraph of the
                 reading? Why did you make this choice?
               2.   Do you believe that animal research can help explain human behavior? Why or why not?

                     Dugatkin hasn’t studied rats.
               2. We can contract the subject pronoun with have or has: I’ve, you’ve, we’ve, they’ve, he’s, she’s, it’s.
                     I’ve read about animal behavior.
                     She’s never taken many risks.
                 The apostrophe s (’s) can mean has or is. The verb form following the contraction will tell you what the
                 contraction means.
                     He’s studied human behavior. = He has studied human behavior.
                     He’s studying human behavior. = He is studying human behavior.

               Notes:
               1. Many adverbs can come between the auxiliary (have/has) and the past participle.
               2.  Already can also come at the end of the verb phrase.

              We use the present perfect for an action that occurred at an indefinite time in the past. This
              action still has importance to a present situation or discussion.

           EXAMPLES                                           EXPLANATION
           We have read about several risk takers already.    We use already in affirmative statements for an
           Over 4,000 people have already climbed Mt. Everest.  indefinite time in the past. We can put already at the
                                                              end of the verb phrase or between the auxiliary verb
                                                              and the main verb.
           A:  I’m planning to climb a mountain next year.    We use yet or already to ask about an expected action.
           B:  Have you begun to train for it yet?
           A:   Yes, I have. But I haven’t trained at a high altitude yet.
           B:  Have you bought your equipment already?        We use yet with a negative verb. We use not yet for a
           A:  No, not yet.                                   short answer.
           A:  Have you written your essay yet?               If we answer a present perfect question with a definite
           B:  Yes. I wrote it last week.                     time, we use the simple past.
           Note:
           Using already in a question shows a greater expectation that something has happened. Using yet indicates you are
           not as sure.
               You expect it has happened: Have you already planned your vacation?
               You aren't sure it has happened: Have you planned your vacation yet?




            GRAMMAR IN USE
            In the U.S., the simple past may also be used with these adverbs, especially in speech:
                A: Did you finish the experiment yet?      B: Yes, I finished it already.
            In the U.K., and other countries influenced by British English (e.g., Australia, South Africa), the present perfect is
            generally preferred.
                A: Have you finished the experiment yet?   B: Yes, I've already finished it.

               Everest.                                         participle.

               B: Yes. He took skydiving lessons last month.    give a definite time and use the simple past.
               I’ve just come back from a rafting trip.         We use just for an action that happened close to the

                                                                perfect. The present perfect is more formal.
               Notes:
               1.  In affirmative statements, recently or lately with the present perfect refers to something that
                 happened over time (in recent weeks, in recent months, in recent years). With the simple past,
                 recently usually refers to a single event.
                      Mt. Everest has had problems with garbage recently. (over a period of time; in recent years)
                      My cousin climbed Mt. Everest recently. (one time)
               2. Lately refers to a repeated or continuous event.
                     We have read a lot of stories about risk lately.
               3. Another way to show recent activity is by using these days.
                     Everest has become crowded and dirty these days.

           EXAMPLES                                          EXPLANATION
           Nik Wallenda has been a performer for many years.  We use for + an amount of time to show the duration

           Nik has been a tightrope performer since 1992.    We use since + a past time or time period to show
                                                             the starting time.

           James Cameron has been interested in the ocean (ever)   We use since or ever since to begin a clause that shows
           since he started work on the movie Titanic.       the start of a continuous action or state. The verb in the

                                                             of an action or state from the past to the present.
           How long has Sylvia Earle been interested in the ocean?  We use how long to ask a question about duration.

                                                             The present perfect connects the past to the present.

           Notes:
           1.  We can use the simple past with for when the event started and ended in the past.
                  Sylvia Earle did research at the University of California from 1969 to 1981. She worked there for 12 years.
           2.  We can use the simple past with how long when the event started and ended in the past. Compare:
                  How long have you lived in the U.S.? (still in the U.S.)
                  How long did you live in your country? (all in the past)
           3.  We can put ever since at the end of the sentence to mean “from the past time mentioned to the present.”
                    She became interested in the ocean as a child, and has been interested in it ever since.




            GRAMMAR IN USE
            When we write a letter to apply for a job or for admission to a school, we often use the present perfect to
            introduce information about our experience. Then we switch to the simple past for specific details.

                  I have worked as a volunteer on several occasions. In the summer of 2019, I worked with an organization to clean
                the beaches in my town. I picked up trash and monitored sea-turtle nests.

           continues to the present.

           PART 1  Editing Advice

             1. Don’t confuse the present participle (verb–ing) and the past participle. In some cases, they
                sound similar.
                                  taken
                     Paul Nicklen has taking many pictures.

             2.  Don’t confuse for and since.

                     Has Wallenda had ever an accident?

             4.  Use yet in negative statements. Use already in affirmative statements.

                     He hasn’t reached the top of the mountain already.
             5.  Don’t forget the -d or -ed ending on past participles of regular verbs.
                               ed
                     We have learn many things about risk takers.

                  A third great thing about Uncle Meyer is that he never stops learning. He’s 68 years old now, and he

              has recently decided to learn Chinese. He has already learn Russian and German pretty well, and now he

               WRITING TIP
               When writing about an experience, you can set the scene with the present perfect, and then switch to the simple
               past when you are ready to give more precise details such as dates, times, and so on.
                   Paul Nicklen has shown us incredible images of the arctic. Last year, he went on an expedition. . .
                   I’ve been to France many times and I’ve always had a wonderful time, but I’ve never forgotten a single thing about
                   my first trip. That was in 2003, when I visited the Côte d’Azur and stayed in a small village with some friends.


              PART 3  Write
              Read the prompts. Choose one and write one or more paragraphs about it.

              1.   Choose a living person you know or have read about who has done great things. This person
                 doesn’t have to be famous or well known. Write a paragraph (or multiple paragraphs) describing
                 what risks this person has taken and why you think he or she is great.
              2.   Sometimes we take a big risk or make a decision to do something new without thinking about
                 the results. Write a paragraph (or multiple paragraphs) telling about a decision you made or a
                 risk you took without thinking about it too much. What was the decision? How has this decision
                 affected your life or the lives of those around you? What have you learned from this experience?

               Passive: Star Wars was directed by George Lucas.    person), we can use either the active or passive voice.
                                                                   The passive with a strong agent is often used with the

               A lot of food was left in the theater after the movie.  When the sentence has a weak agent (identity of the
               Sully was made in 2016.                             agent is not important, not known, or is obvious),

               Active: The screenwriter is going to adapt his next script   The passive voice can be used to shift the emphasis to
               from a recent news story.                           the object of the preceding sentence.

               Passive: The screenwriter’s next script is going to be

               Active: The director bases most of her movies on real life.
               Passive: Most of the director’s movies are based on real life.
               I was told that you didn’t like the movie.          The passive voice can be used to hide the identity of

               Formal: The movie was filmed in just three weeks.



                GRAMMAR IN USE
                Using active or passive voice is often based on the formality required by the situation. Passive often sounds more
                formal. For example:
                Talking to friends: They’re going to increase the price of a movie ticket.
                In the news: In the next year, ticket prices are going to be increased.


              EXERCISE 4  Some of the following sentences have a strong agent and can be changed to passive
              voice using the agent. Some have a weak agent and should be changed to passive voice without the
              agent. Change all sentences to passive voice.

                                                    ANIMATION








                                                  Read the following article. Pay special attention to the words in bold.   3.3

                                                     You have probably seen some great computer-animated movies, like
                                                  Toy Story, Finding Nemo, or Frozen. Computer animation has become
                                                  the norm  in today’s world. But animation has been around for over one
                                                          1
                                                  hundred years. It has changed a lot over time. How was it done before
                                                  computers were invented?

                                                     Early animations were created by hand. At the beginning of the
                                                  1900s, Winsor McCay, who is considered the father of animation, worked
                                                  alone and animated his films by himself. He drew every picture separately
                                                  and had them photographed, one at a time. Hundreds of photographs
                                                  were needed to make a one-minute film. It took him more than a year
                                                  and 10,000 drawings to create a five-minute animation called Gertie the
                                                  Dinosaur. It was shown to audiences in theaters in 1914.

                                                     After celluloid (a transparent material) was developed, animation
                                                  became easier. Instead of drawing each picture separately, the animator
                                                  could make a drawing of the background, which remained motionless,
                                                  while only the characters moved.
                                                     Walt Disney, the creator of Mickey Mouse, took animation to a new
                                                  level. He added sound and music to his movies and produced the first
                                                  full-length animated film, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Many
                                                  people think he was a great animator, but he wasn’t. Instead, he worked
                                                  mainly as a story editor. He was also a clever businessman who had
                                                  other artists do most of the drawings.

                                                     Toy Story, which came out in 1995, was the first computer-animated
                                                  film. Computer animation was also used for special effects in movies
                                                  such as Star Wars and Avatar. If you’ve seen Life of Pi, you may be
                                                  surprised to learn that the tiger was done by animation. To create
                                                  the illusion of movement in these films, an image  was put on the
                                                                                              3
                                                            2

                                                  change. While this technique is similar to hand-drawn animation, the
                                                  work can be done much faster on the computer. In fact, anyone with a
                                                  home computer and special software can create a simple animation.

              3.7  Participles Used as Adjectives


               EXAMPLES                                       EXPLANATION

               Today’s movies use advanced technology.        Some past participles are used as adjectives.
               Chaplin was not an educated man.
               Chaplin had an amazing life.                   Some present participles are used as adjectives.
               In later life, he faced declining popularity.
               Chaplin was extremely hardworking.             An adverb sometimes precedes the participle.
               He was a highly paid actor.
               Chaplin’s life interests me. (interest = verb)  In some cases, both the present participle (a) and the past
               (a) Chaplin’s life is interesting. He made many   participle (b) of the same verb can be used as adjectives.
               interesting movies.                            The present participle (a) has an active meaning. Someone
               (b) I am interested in learning more about Chaplin.  or something actively causes a feeling in others.
                                                              The past participle (b) gives a passive meaning. It describes
               Chaplin amuses us. (amuse = verb)              the person who passively experiences a feeling.
               (a) The Little Tramp was an amusing character. He did
               many amusing things.
               (b) We saw his movie and we were amused.
               Chaplin was an interesting person.             A person can cause a feeling in others (be terrifying) or he
               Chaplin was interested in acting from a young age.  can experience a feeling (be terrified).
               I saw a scary movie, and I was terrified.
               The story about Chaplin is interesting.        An object (like a story or a movie) doesn’t have feelings, so
               Chaplin’s movies are entertaining.             a past participle, such as interested or entertained, cannot be
                                                              used to describe an object.
               Note:
               Some common paired participles are:
               amazing           amazed                               exhausting      exhausted
               amusing           amused                               frightening     frightened

           PART 1  Editing Advice
             1. Use be, not do, to make negatives and questions with the passive voice.

                             wasn’t
                     The movie didn’t made in Hollywood.

             2.  Don’t use the passive voice with intransitive verbs.
                     The main character was died at the end of the movie.

             3.  Don’t confuse the present participle with the past participle.
                                   eaten
                     Popcorn is often eating during a movie.

             4.  Don’t forget the –d/–ed ending for a regular past participle.
                                ed                            d
                     Music was play during silent movies.   I got bore during the movie and fell asleep.

             5.  Don’t forget to use a form of be in a passive sentence.
                             was
                     The movie  seen by everyone in my family.
             6.  Use by to show the agent of the action. Use an object pronoun after by.
                                       by                                  him
                     Life of Pi was directed for Ang Lee.   Hulk was also directed by he.
             7. In present and past questions and negatives, use do when you use get with the passive voice.

                     My favorite movie wasn’t get nominated.
             8.  Don’t forget to include a verb (usually be) before a participle used as an adjective.

                     The movie theater  located on the corner of Main and Elm Streets.
             9.  Use be, not do, with past participles used as adjectives.

               WRITING TIP
               Many reference books tell you to avoid using passive sentences. This does not mean you should never use one. It
               is important to understand that the passive voice is useful in certain situations. For example, the passive voice is
               important when you want:
               1.  to maintain focus on the topic
                 There is a new movie that everyone is talking about. The movie is considered one of the best of the year.
                 NOT: There is a new movie that everyone is talking about. Everyone considers it the best movie of the year.
               2.  to avoid criticizing someone
                 The actor was told to cry a lot, which ruined the movie.
                 NOT: The director told the actor to cry a lot, which ruined the movie.


              PART 3  Write
              Read the prompts. Choose one and write one or more paragraphs about it.

              1.   How are American films different from films made in your country or another country you know

           COMPREHENSION  Based on the reading, write T for true or F for false.
            1.       By the time the Titanic was built, the airplane had already been invented.

            2.       There were enough lifeboats for most of the passengers.
            3.       The Titanic sank in under an hour.


           THINK ABOUT IT  Discuss the questions with a partner or in a small group.

            1.   Why were 12 of the 32 lifeboats removed before the voyage of the Titanic? Why do you think the safety
              of the passengers was not as much a concern?

            2.   What is another deep sea discovery that has been made? Would you like to dive to such sites? Explain
              your answer.

                    The captain knew about the ice. He’d had a chance to turn the ship around, but he didn’t.
           2.  The contraction for had not is hadn’t.
                  He hadn’t paid attention to the warnings.
           3.  Apostrophe + d (‘d) can be a contraction for both had or would. The verb form following the

                  Jack Thayer was a 17-year-old passenger on the Titanic, traveling with his parents.

              He    had just said    goodnight to his parents and was getting ready to go to bed when he felt a bump.

           When showing the time relationship between past events, the past perfect is used to show
           the event that took place first.

                GRAMMAR IN USE
                The past perfect is not used as often as the simple past. If the time is clear, we use the simple past. However,
                there are times when the past perfect is needed.
                   Jack  left for Brazil yesterday. (Yesterday makes the time clear.)
                   Before he left, he said “good-bye” to all his friends. (Before makes time clear.)
                     By the time he arrived in Brazil, he had read his travel guide. (By the time indicates a time period leading up to a
                   past time, which requires the past perfect.)

           PRESENT PERFECT (RELATES THE PAST TO THE PRESENT)
           So far, we have read three stories about transportation.
           Have you taken any trips lately?
           Ordinary citizens haven’t traveled into space yet.
           I have a driver’s license now. I have had my license for three months.


           PRESENT PERFECT CONTINUOUS (RELATES PAST TO PRESENT)
           We have been reading about transportation for three days.
           Ever since we started this unit, I have been thinking about taking a trip.
           Is your son driving to California now? How long has he been driving?
           We’ve been learning a lot about travel in the past few days.



           SIMPLE PAST
           Lewis and Clark crossed the Rocky Mountains on horseback.
           They returned from the West two and a half years later.
           They were very brave.
           They made their expedition over 200 years ago.



           PAST CONTINUOUS
           While the Titanic was crossing the Atlantic, it hit an iceberg.
           Jack Thayer was getting ready for bed when he felt a bump.
           At 11:40 p.m. many passengers were sleeping.



           PAST PERFECT
           When Millvina Dean died in 2009, all the other Titanic survivors had already died.
           In 1912, the Titanic was the most magnificent ship that had ever been built.
           To make the Titanic look more elegant, lifeboats had been removed.
           By the time the DC-3 airplane reached California, it had made several stops.



           PAST PERFECT CONTINUOUS
           By the time the DC-3 airplane reached California, passengers had been traveling for more
           than 18 hours.
           The Titanic had been traveling for four days when it hit an iceberg.

               WRITING TIP
               When writing about the past, it is important to review your work to check for correct and consistent use of past
               verb forms. A basic reference:

               •  past continuous for background description
                   It  was raining hard and traffic was moving slowly.

               •  simple past for events at particular moments
                   We arrived at the hotel after dark. The hotel didn’t have any rooms.

               •  past perfect for related events that happened before those particular moments
                   The hotel had given our room to someone else.

               2.  Which of the password tips are the most important, in your opinion?



              5.1  Modals—An Overview

              The modal verbs are can, could, should, would, may, might, must, and will. Modals add
              meaning to the verbs that follow them.

               EXAMPLES                                          EXPLANATION
               You should change your password frequently.       A base form follows a modal.
               The password for my bank account must include     A modal never has an -s ending.
               at least one number.
               You should not tell anyone your password.         To form the negative, we put not after the modal.
               I cannot remember so many passwords.              The negative of can is written as one word:
                                                                 cannot. The contraction for cannot is can’t.

               Passwords should be changed frequently.           To form the passive with a modal, we use the
               Passwords must be entered exactly.                modal + be + past participle.
               I can’t remember so many passwords. = I am not able   Expressions that are like modals in meaning are:
               to remember so many passwords.                    have to, have got to, be able to, be allowed to,
                                                                 be permitted to, be supposed to, had better.
               You must use letters and numbers. = You have to use
               letters and numbers.
               Observe these seven patterns with a modal:
               AffirmAtive StAtement:       You  should choose a password.
               negAtive StAtement:          You  shouldn’t choose your name or birthday.
               Yes/No QueStion:             Should you choose a long password?

               Subject QueStion:            Who should choose a long password?

            GRAMMAR IN USE
            When talking about a personal obligation, we tend to avoid must because it sounds very official or urgent and is
            too strong for personal situations. It is more natural to use have to or have got to.

                9.   Your password is case-sensitive. That means you (must/ought to) type it exactly the way you typed it
                  originally, with uppercase and lowercase letters.

               Pronunciation Note:
                 Informally, have in past modals is often contracted to ‘ve and sounds like the word “of.” Sometimes it is reduced to
               just the schwa sound /ә/. These words are written in very informal writing as shoulda and coulda.

               2.  A:  Lincoln was a wonderful president.
                 B:  I agree. Without him, slavery                              much longer.

                 B:   I guess they just wanted to make money. They                             rich without slaves.

              A:  I don’t think he wrote it fast. I think he chose his words very carefully.

              A:  I don’t know how to do that.

               Why didn’t the audience react after Lincoln’s speech?  We use may/might/could + have + the past participle to
               They could have been surprised.                  express a possibility about the past. It is not used to say
                 They may have expected him to speak more.      something that was known to be true.
                 They might have thought that he wasn't finished.
               Everett’s speech may not have been very interesting.  To show negative possibility, we use may not have and
               Lincoln might not have realized how good his     might not have. We don’t use could not have because it has

                                      . John Wilkes Booth, the man who assassinated Abraham Lincoln,
                2.  maybe you didn’t hear
           was a famous actor. His brother, Edwin, was also an actor. John may
                                                                            3.  maybe John was not
           as good an actor as his brother, but he was very popular, especially with women. This could
                                      because he was very handsome. John Booth hated the president and was in
                  4.  maybe this was
           favor of slavery. Edwin was on Lincoln’s side. John and Edwin argued so much about Lincoln and slavery
           that Edwin finally refused to have John in his house. John was planning to harm the president. At first, he

           might                                   to kill the president, but later he decided to assassinate him.
                         5.  maybe he didn’t plan
              In a hotel in Pennsylvania, where John Booth often stayed, someone had written these words near a window:
           “Abe Lincoln Departed This Life August 13th, 1864 By The Effects of Poison.” After the death of Lincoln, people

           thought that John Booth may                         these words. But this is not certain. There were many
                                        6.  maybe John Booth wrote
           people who hated Lincoln, and someone else could                       that sentence.
                                                          7.  maybe someone else wrote
              In 1865, Lincoln was attending a play at the Ford Theater in Washington, DC. Booth was not an actor

           in that play, but because he had acted there before, no one thought anything of his presence at the theater.
           While Lincoln was sitting with his wife watching the play, Booth entered the president’s box and shot him.

           At first, it was thought that he may                      Lincoln, but it was soon evident that

           Booth had shot him. The next morning, Lincoln died.
              There’s another interesting story about the Booth brothers. A few months before the assassination, Robert,

           Lincoln’s son, was standing on a train platform. Just as the train was arriving, Robert fell on the tracks. It could

                                      because of the crowds pushing. A stranger reached out and pulled Robert to
                   9.  maybe it was

                     The bodyguard shouldn’t  left the theater.
             3.  Don’t use of after a modal to express past. Use the auxiliary verb have.

           Pierre Omidyar









           Read the following article. Pay special attention to the words in bold.   7.1

              Did you ever want to sell a birthday present that you didn’t like? Or an old
           guitar that is taking up space in your closet? In the old days, buyers and sellers
                                                              1
           were limited to newspapers, garage sales, and flea markets  in the area where they
           lived. But in the early 1990s, when people started to use the Internet, Pierre
           Omidyar had an idea. Omidyar, who was working as a computer programmer,
           realized that sellers no longer had to be limited to finding buyers who lived
           in their local area. He came up with the idea of eBay, which he started as a
           hobby. He didn’t charge money at first because he wasn’t sure eBay would
           work. Buying online requires you to trust sellers whom you’ve never met. But
           people liked eBay. Soon there was so much activity on eBay that his Internet
           service provider upgraded his site to a business account, which was no longer
           free. So Omidyar started to charge the sellers a small fee for each sale. Before
           long, this hobby grew into a big business.
              By 1998, eBay had become so big that Omidyar needed a business expert.
           He brought in Meg Whitman, whose knowledge of business helped make
           eBay a success. She changed eBay from a company that sold used
           things in several categories to a large marketplace of 78
           million items, both new and used, in 50,000 categories.

              Many companies that start out well on the Internet
           later fail. When Whitman left the company, it started to
           decline. In 2008, John Donahoe was brought in as the
                   2
           new CEO . He fired many people who had been working
           there for years. He understood that smartphones and
           tablets were changing the way that people shopped;
           people no longer had to shop from their home
           computers. He created an eBay app so that people
           could shop 24/7 and could pay with one click. eBay,
           which was about to follow other Internet businesses
           into decline, was brought back to life.

              By the time Omidyar was 31, he was worth more
           than $7 billion. The money that he has earned is
           much more than he needs. He and his wife signed a
           promise, the Giving Pledge, to donate the majority of
           their wealth during their lifetime.

               Notes:
               1.  The relative pronoun is usually omitted in conversation when it is the object of the adjective
                  clause.
                      I sold the lamp that my aunt gave me.
                      I bought a laptop from a seller whom I’ve never met.
               2.  Whom is considered more formal than who when used as the object of the adjective clause.
                  However, as seen in the note above, the relative pronoun is usually omitted in conversation.
                      Pierre Omidyar is a man whom I greatly admire. (very formal)
                      Pierre Omidyar is a man who  or  that I greatly admire. (common)

               3.  When there is no new subject after the relative pronoun, the relative pronoun is the subject of
                  the adjective clause and cannot be omitted.
                      My neighborhood has a bookstore that has a reading hour for children.
                     not My neighborhood has a bookstore that has a reading hour for children.
               4.  When a new subject is introduced in the adjective clause, the relative pronoun is the object of
                  the adjective clause and can be omitted.
                      My neighborhood has a bookstore (that) the children love. (the children " new subject)



                GRAMMAR IN USE
                A common error is to repeat the object at the end of the adjective clause. Be sure to avoid this.

                   I bought it from a seller that I’ve never met.
                   not I bought it from a seller that I’ve never met him.

                                            ? Carla, right?

              A:   Yeah, Carla. She thought I spent too much time taking pictures, texting, and using the Internet.

                So she broke up with me.

              B:  I see you still have some pictures of Carla on your phone.

              A:  Oh, right. I’d better delete the pictures                   of Carla before Nina sees them.

              A:  I hope I can follow the advice                      me. If not, I’ll lose Nina.

           The relative pronoun can be the object of a preposition (to, about, with, of, etc.). Usually the
           preposition is at the end of the adjective clause.

           PEOPLE

                                              prep.  object

                              The person to whom I sold my computer paid me $200. (Formal)

           THINGS


                                                  prep.     object
                            Bezos started the business with this money.

                                        that
                            The money     Ø    Bezos started his business with came from his parents.
                                       which

                            The money with which Bezos started his business came from his parents.

           Notes:
           1.  We usually put the preposition at the end of the adjective clause and omit the relative pronoun.
                  The person I sold my computer to paid me $200.
                  Do you know the person you bought your laptop from?
           2.  In very formal English, we put the preposition before whom and which. That is not used directly
              after a preposition.
                  The person to whom I sold my computer paid me $200. (not: to who or to that)
                  The money with which Bezos started his business came from his parents. (not: to that)



           EXERCISE 7  Make these sentences more informal by taking out the relative pronoun and putting the
           preposition at the end of the adjective clause.


            1.  There are several travel websites in which I am interested.
              There are several travel websites I’m interested in.


            2.  There is a new website about which everyone is talking.



            3.  The link on which you click will take you to that site.



            4.  The information for which you are looking can be found on that site.

               EXAMPLES                                        EXPLANATION
                                                               We can express place in an adjective clause with:
               The city where I live has a recycling group.           •  where to mean “in that place”
               The city in which I live has a recycling group.          •  a preposition + which (formal)
               The city (that) I live in has a recycling group.         •  that/which or Ø + clause + preposition
               Please specify times (when) you ’ll be home.    We can express time in an adjective clause with when or Ø.
               This is the place where I used to live.         Where means in that place or there.
               This is the restaurant that I’m always talking about.   That refers to the noun that precedes it.
               I can’t remember a time when there was no Internet.   When means at that time or then.
               I felt bad that time that I lost a person’s package.   That refers to the noun that precedes it.


              EXERCISE 9  Circle the correct words to complete the conversation. In some cases, both choices are
              correct, so circle both options.

               A:  Grandma, I can’t imagine a time (when/where) there were no computers.

               B:   It wasn’t such a long time ago. When I was in high school, we had never seen a computer. We used typewriters

                 to write our papers. There was a special room in my school (where/that) you could go and use the typewriters.
                                                                         2.
               A:  You mean like a computer lab?

               B:   Something like that. Later I read a book about computers, and I wanted to know more. At the

                 time (Ø/when) I first became interested in computers, I didn’t know anyone who had one.
                         3.
               A:  Did you buy your computer online?

               B:   Oh, no. I’m talking about a time (when/about which) no one had even heard of the Internet. There were very
                                                      4.
                 few stores (Ø/where) you could buy computers. And they were so expensive.

               Girls Who Code is based in the U.S., where it has reached
               girls in all 50 states.                            extra information to an already complete sentence.
               Smartphones changed the way (that) people shop.    In these examples the adjective clause is essential,
               Jeff Bezos wanted a company name that began with A.  because, without it, we can’t identify the noun. If we
               People who want quick information can use the Web.  take the adjective clause out, the noun isn’t properly
                                                                  identified, and the idea isn’t complete.
               (a) Saujani, who founded Girls Who Code in 2012, thinks   In example (a), Saujani is unique and does not need to
               there should be more women in computer science.    be identified. The clause is nonessential.
               b) The computer, which was invented in the 1940s, has   Example (b) refers to the whole class of computers as
               become part of our everyday lives.                 an invention. The clause is nonessential.
               (c) The computer that I bought two years ago is slow   Example (c) refers to only one computer, which
               compared to today’s computers.                     is identified by the adjective clause. The clause is
                                                                  essential.
               The computer (that) she just bought has a lot of memory. In an essential adjective clause, the relative pronoun
               The Web, which Tim Berners-Lee created, is a useful tool. that can be used or omitted.
                                                                  In a nonessential adjective clause, the relative pronoun

                                                                  omitted.
               Notes:
               Here are some questions to help you decide if the adjective clause needs commas. If the answer to
               any of these questions is yes, then the adjective clause is set off by commas.
                 ✓  Can I put the adjective clause in parentheses?
                        Google (which was founded in 1998) is a popular search engine.
                 ✓  If the adjective clause is deleted, does the sentence still make sense?
                        Google is a popular search engine.
                 ✓  Is the noun a unique person, place, or thing?
                        Reshma Saujani, who is an advocate for more women in computer science, founded Girls Who Code.
                 ✓  If the noun is plural, am I including all members of a group?
                          Personal computers, which became popular in the 1990s, have changed the way we get information.
                        (all personal computers)



              EXERCISE 14  Decide which of the following sentences contain a nonessential adjective clause. Put
              commas in those sentences. If the sentence doesn’t need commas, write OK.

                1. People who text use abbreviations. OK
                2. My father, who texted me a few minutes ago, is sick.

           PART 1  Editing Advice
             1.  Never use what as a relative pronoun.
                                                        who
                     I bought a used computer from a person what lives in another state.
                            that or Ø
                     Everything what we learned about the Internet is interesting.
             2.  You can’t omit a relative pronoun that is the subject of the adjective clause.
                                who
                     I have a cousin  doesn’t have a computer.
             3.  If the relative pronoun is the object of the adjective clause, don’t put an object after the verb.

                     The software that I bought it online was very useful.
             4.  Make sure you use subject-verb agreement in the adjective clause.
                                        s
                     I have a friend who use e-mail a lot.

             5.  Put a noun before an adjective clause.
                A person who
                     Who doesn’t know how to use a computer in today’s world is lost.

             6.  Don’t confuse whose with who’s.
                              whose
                     The person who’s computer I bought didn’t charge for shipping.

             7.  Put the subject before the verb in an adjective clause.
                                   my grandfather uses
                     The computer that uses my grandfather is very old.

             8.  Use whose, not his, her, or their to show possession in an adjective clause.
                                 whose
                     I have a friend who his knowledge of programming is very advanced.

                Passive sentences can sometimes sound very formal in ordinary conversation. The causative verbs have and get
                are often used instead.

                   My car is being repaired next week.
                   I'm having my car repaired next week. / I’m getting my car repaired next week.



              EXERCISE 7  Circle the correct verb form to complete each conversation.

               1.  A:  Do you always give to charity?

                 B:  I know I should. But I don’t always do it.

                 A:   Whenever I get a gift in the mail from a charity, I send a check. I think this is a good way to get

                    people (give/to give).

                 B:  What kind of gifts do you receive in the mail?

                 A:  I often get address labels. Don’t you?

                 B:   Yes, but that doesn’t persuade me (donate/to donate) money. I just use the labels and throw away

                    the donation envelope.

               2.  A:  I volunteered for the public TV station last month.

                 B:  What did they have you (do/to do)?

                 A:   My job was to address envelopes. It was fun. I met other volunteers. And it made me ( feel/to feel)

                    good about watching the station.

               3.  A:  I have a doctor’s appointment on Friday, and my car doesn’t work.

                 B:  Let me (drive/to drive) you.

                 A:  I don’t want to bother you.

                 B:  It’s not a bother. I love to volunteer my time.

               4.  A:  When I was a child, my parents gave me money once a week.

                 B:  Did they let you (buy/to buy) whatever you wanted?

                 A:   They allowed me (use/to use) half of the money. They had me (save/to save) the other half.

              To form a gerund, we put an -ing ending on a verb. A gerund is used as a noun (subject or object).

               EXAMPLES                                          EXPLANATION
               Contributing money is one way to help.            A gerund (phrase) can be used as the subject.
               Volunteering your time is another way to help.
               Dawson started working in 1940.                   A gerund (phrase) can be used after certain verbs.

               Notes:
               1.  To make a gerund negative, we put not before the gerund.
                     Not finishing high school limits job possibilities.
               2.  For a passive gerund, we use being + past participle.
                      We appreciate being given the opportunity to have an education.
               3.  A gerund subject takes a singular verb.
                      Helping others gives a person pleasure.

                                                              as slaves from Africa. Almost half a million Africans
                                                              were brought to work in the agricultural South.
                                                              African families were torn apart as slaves were treated

                                                                 In 1776, when the thirteen American colonies

                                                              Jefferson, one of the founding fathers of the United
                                                              States, wrote, “All men are created equal” and that
                                                              every person has a right to “life, liberty, and the
                                                              pursuit of happiness.” In spite of these great words,
                                                              Jefferson owned 200 slaves. The newly formed U.S.
                                                              Constitution considered each slave to be three-fifths
           A slave family picking cotton                      of a person. In order to keep slaves divided from each
           near Savannah, Georgia
                                                              other and dependent on their masters, they were
                                                              prohibited from learning to read and write.

                                Since the main southern crop, tobacco, was exhausting the land at the end of the
                             18th century, it seemed that the need for slavery would come to an end. However, there
                             was suddenly a big demand for cotton. Previously, the production of cotton had been very
                             slow because it was very time-consuming to remove the seeds. But a new invention made
                             the production of cotton much faster. Suddenly, southern farmers found a new area of
                             wealth—and a new reason to keep slaves. Even though the African slave trade ended in
                             1808, domestic slave trade continued. The slave population continued to grow as children
                             were born to slave mothers. By 1860, there were four million slaves in the United States.

                                The country became divided over the issue of slavery, and the Civil War, between the
                             North and the South, was fought from 1861 to 1865. In spite of the fact that the North won
                             and African Americans were freed, it took another hundred years for Congress to pass a
                             law prohibiting discrimination because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.
                                Although many new arrivals see the United States as the land of opportunity for
                             everyone, there are still many challenges and a lot of work to be done.

           9.7  Sentence Connectors

           Sentence connectors, also called transistions, show the relationship between the ideas.

           Punctuation Notes:
           1.  We use either a period or a semicolon (;) before a sentence connector if it comes at the
              beginning of a sentence or clause. We use a comma after a sentence connector.

                  My friend Carlos was accepted into the DACA program; therefore, he was able to attend college.
           2.  Some sentence connectors can come in the middle of a sentence. We separate these from the
              sentence by putting a comma before and after the connector.
                  Many people want to immigrate to America. The process, however, can be long and complicated.

              10.1  Noun Clauses


              A noun clause functions as a noun in a sentence. Like all clauses, it has a subject and a verb.

               EXAMPLES                                              EXPLANATION
               Parents know (that) kids need a lot of attention.     A noun clause can follow certain verbs.
               Studies show (that) early childhood education is important.  That introduces a noun clause. That is often
                                                                     omitted, especially in conversation.

               I’m sure (that) children need a lot of attention.     A noun clause can be the complement of the
               Some parents are worried (that) they don’t spend enough   sentence after certain adjectives.
               time with their kids.
               A: I hope that our children will be successful.       Noun clauses can be replaced by so after the verbs
               B: I hope so, too.                                    think, hope, believe, suppose, expect, and know.
               A:  Do you think that the children are learning in preschool?
               B: Yes, I think so.

               I believe that babies’ brains are fascinating and that they   We connect two noun clauses in the same sentence

               I agree that the study is important but that care must be
               given to the babies.

               Notes:
                 1.  A noun clause often follows one of these verbs:
                     believe     find out      predict        suppose
                    complain     forget        pretend        think
                    decide       hope          realize        understand
                    dream        know          regret
                    expect       learn         remember
                    feel*        notice        show

                  *  Feel followed by a noun clause means “believe” or “think.”
                        I feel that early education is important.

                 2.  A noun clause often follows be + the following adjectives:
                    afraid       clear         sure
                    amazed       disappointed  surprised

               Notes:
                 1.  We use an exact quote when we want to write exactly what someone has said.
                  Exact quotes are common in stories and news reports.
                 2.  We use reported speech when we want to report what someone has said.




              EXERCISE 13  In the paragraph below, underline the noun clauses that show reported speech. Circle
              the verbs in the noun clauses.

                  Last week, my daughter’s teacher called me at work and told me that my daughter had a fever

              and was resting in the nurse’s office. I told my boss that I needed to leave work immediately. He

              said that it would be fine. As I was driving my car on the highway to the school, a police officer

              stopped me. She said that I was driving too fast. She said that I had been going 10 miles per hour

              over the limit. I told her that I was in a hurry because my daughter was sick. I said I needed to

              get to her school quickly. I told the police officer that I was sorry, that I hadn’t realized I had

              been driving so fast. She said she wouldn’t give me a ticket that time, but that I should be more

              careful in the future, whether my daughter was sick or not.



              ABOUT YOU  Complete the sentences with real things that people have said to you. Use exact quotes as
              far as you can remember them. Then tell a partner using reported speech.

           After a past tense verb in the main clause (such as said, told, reported, wrote, etc.), the tense of
           the verb in the noun clause moves back one tense. Notice the difference in verb tenses in the
           exact quotes on the left and the reported speech on the right.


           EXACT QUOTE                                       REPORTED SPEECH
           He said, “I know you.”                            He said (that) he knew me.
                   (present)                                        (simple past)
           He said, “I am studying.”                         He said (that) he was studying.
                   (present continuous)                             (past continuous)
           He said, “She saw me yesterday.”                  He said (that) she had seen him the day before.
                   (simple past)                                    (past perfect)
           He said, “She was helping me.”                    He said (that) she had been helping him.
                   (past continuous)                                (past perfect continuous)
           He said, “I have taken the test.”                 He said (that) he had taken the test.
                   (present perfect)                                 (past perfect)
           He said, “I had never done that.”                 He said (that) he had never done that. (No change)
                   (past perfect)                                    (past perfect)
           Modals
           She said, “I can help you tomorrow.”              She said (that) she could help me the next day.
           She said, “She may leave early.” (possibility)    She said (that) she might leave early.
           She said, “You may go.” (permission)              She said (that) I could go.
           She said, “I must go.”                            She said (that) she had to go.
           She said, “I will stay.”                          She said (that) she would stay.
           She said, “You should leave.”                     She said (that) I should leave. (No change)
           She said, “You must have known.”                  She said (that) I must have known. (No change)
           Notes:
             1.  Observe all the differences between a sentence that has an exact quote and a sentence that
              uses reported speech.
              EXACT QUOTE:                               REPORTED SPEECH:
              She said, “I will help you tomorrow.”      She said (that) she would help me the next day.
                  •  quotation marks                         •  no quotation marks
                  •  comma after said                        •  no comma after said
                  •  doesn’t contain that                    •  contains that (optional)
                  •  pronouns = I, you                       •  pronouns = she, me
                  •  verb = will help                        •  verb = would help
                  •  time = tomorrow                         •  time = the next day
             2.  Other time word changes in reported speech:
                  today → that day                                 this morning → that morning
                  yesterday → the day before; the previous day     tonight → that night
                  tomorrow → the next day; the following day       now → at that time
             3.  We even change the tense in the following sentence:
                  The teacher asked me what my name was.
              The tense shows that the conversation took place at a different time and place.

           EXAMPLES                                          EXPLANATION

           She said that her son was a good driver.          In reported speech, say is not followed by an
                                                             indirect object.


           She told me that her son was a good driver.       In reported speech, tell is followed by an indirect object.
           She said, “I love you.”                           In an exact quote, we use say or say to someone.
           She said to her daughter, “I love you.”           We do not usually use tell in an exact quote.

           Notes:
             1.  Other verbs used in reported speech that do not have an indirect object are:
              add, answer, explain, reply.
                  She explained that she had never had an accident.
             2.  Other verbs used in reported speech that have an indirect object are:
              inform, notify, remind, promise.
                  She reminded her son that he should drive safely.

           10.10  Using Reported Speech to Paraphrase

           We often use reported speech when we want to paraphrase what someone has said. The exact
           words are not important or not remembered. The idea is more important than the exact words.

           EXACT QUOTE                                       REPORTED SPEECH

           of a gifted child.”                               but even more so.

           Alma answered, “I want to write beautiful music   Alma said that she hoped her music could improve
           because I want to make the world a better place.”  the world.

           Notes:
             1.  Remember: Reported speech is often a paraphrase of what someone has said.
                  She asked me, “Do your kids spend a lot of time in front of the TV?”
                  She asked me if my kids watched a lot of TV.
             2.  The most common changes that are made are:
                  will → would   can → could





            GRAMMAR IN USE
            When a statement is still true or it is reported soon after it is spoken, the verb in reported speech often does not
            follow the rule of sequence of tenses after said, thought, and so on. This is especially true in conversation.

                   He said the post office is a big glass building. (“It is a big glass building.”)
                   A: What's wrong with Hernando?
                   B: He told me he's very tired today. (“I’m very tired today.”)

              When I was 18 years old and living in my native Estonia, I didn’t know where

           program in the U.S. This is a program where young people go to live with a family for a year to

           take care of their small children.

              I became very excited and asked my mother (if I could/could I) apply. At first she said,
                                                             4.
           “Absolutely not.” She asked me why (did I want/I wanted) to leave our family for a year. I told her
                                                   5.
           that it (will/would) be a good opportunity for me to improve my English and gain experience.
                     6.
           My mother said she would talk it over with Dad, and they finally agreed to let me go.

              After filling out the application, I had an interview. The interviewer asked me what kind of
           experience (did I have/I had) with small children. I told her that I had two younger brothers and
                            7.
           that I always helped my parents take care of them.

              She also asked me (whether/if) I (knew/had known) how to drive. Sometimes an au pair has

           (if I would/would I) get paid, and she said I would be paid about $200 a week. I also wanted to
                  12.
           know (if/whether) I (would have/had had) the opportunity to go to school in the U.S., and she

              I was so happy when I was accepted. My year in the U.S. was wonderful. When I got back,

           I knew what I (wanted/had wanted) to do. I majored in early childhood education and I am now

                  Two years ago, when I was 18, I didn’t know   what to do   with my life. I had just graduated
                                                           1.  What should I do?
              from high school, and I couldn’t decide                                                 .
                                                                 2.  Should I go to college or not?
              A neighbor of mine told me                                                      and decided to
                                                  3.  I had the same problem when I was your age.
              go to the U.S. for a year to work as an au pair. She asked me                                  .
                                                                          4.  Have you ever heard of this program?
              I told her                   . She told me                                                 , and
                            5.  I haven’t.                       6.  I lived with an American family for a year.
                                     . I asked her                                         . I was surprised to
              7.  My English has improved a lot.        8.  How much will this program cost me?
              find out                                                    . I asked her
                                     9.  You’ll earn about $200 a week.
                                                        , and she said                 but
                          10.  Is the work very hard?                     11.  It is.
                                                  .
                        12.  It is very rewarding.
                  When I told my parents                                                       , they told me
                                                  13.  I am thinking about going to the U.S. for a year.
                                  . They thought                                         and
                   14.  Don’t go.                           15.  You are too young.
                                             . I reminded them
                  16.  You don’t have any experience.
                                                                                    . I didn’t think
                                17.  I have babysat our neighbors’ kids many times.
                                            , but to my surprise they did. When I filled out the application, I was afraid
                      18.  Will they agree?
                                                  . But I was. My parents were worried. I told them
                        19.  I won’t be accepted.
                                       . I promised them                                                   .
                     20.  Don’t worry.                              21.  I will e-mail you almost every day.

                                                                          22.  What do I have to do?
              two small kids, and I had to wake them, make them breakfast, and take them to school in the morning.

              I asked them                                                                . They told me that
                                             23.  Do I have to wait for them at school?
                                                                                                . I told them
                                   24.  While the kids are in school, you can take English classes.
                                                                                                . They told me
                                       25.  I don’t have enough money to pay for school.
                                                          . I was so happy to study English. When the year was
                          26.  We will pay for your classes.
              over, I was very sad to leave my new family, but we promised                             .
                                                                             27.  We will stay in touch.
                  Now I am back home and in college. My parents can see                               . I don’t
                                                                           28.  I’ve become more mature.
              know                                                          , but for me it was great.
                                    29.  Is this experience for everyone?

               WRITING TIP
               Use exact quotes in your writing to bring life to your writing. However, using too many exact quotes can cause your
               own “voice” to be lost. If you need to include a lot of other people’s ideas, reported speech can help you maintain a
               balance between other people’s words and your own writing.

              11.1  Unreal Conditionals—Present


              An unreal conditional is used to talk about an imagined situation. An unreal conditional in
              the present describes a situation that is not real now.

               EXAMPLES                                          EXPLANATION
               If we had a time machine, we could travel to the future.   We use a past form in the if clause and would or could +

               (Reality: I can’t travel to the past.)            first, there is no comma.

               1.       Bringing back dinosaurs would change the world.

               2.       Dinosaur DNA is not too old to allow scientists to bring them back.

               3.       Most people agree that bringing back dinosaurs would be an exciting idea.

           I’d love to meet my great-grandparents.           Sometimes the conditional (the if clause) is implied, and,
           I could ask them about their lives.               therefore, not stated. In the examples, the implication
           Would you like to see a living dinosaur?          is “if you had the opportunity” or “if the possibility
           I wouldn’t want to know the future. Would you?    presented itself.”

                      FUN WITH GRAMMAR


                 Play a chain game using real and unreal conditionals! You can either practice by writing your answers on a
                 shared piece of paper, or by speaking with your group.

                 Get into groups of three to five. The first student will complete the provided if clause. For example:
                    If I won a trip to Europe, I would go to France.
                 The next student will take the main clause and form a new conditional sentence.
                    If I went to France, I would visit Paris.
                 This chain continues until you are all out of logical ideas. Check each other’s work and correct any errors. Use
                 one or more of the following prompts. If you write your answers, read them to the class when you are done.
                 1. If we all live to be 100,                                                                 .
                 2. If I were fluent in English,                                                              .
                 3. If I take a vacation this year,                                                           .

                 4. If I were very rich and famous,                                                           .

           VERB → PAST                                       VERB → WOULD/COULD/MIGHT + BASE FORM
           If I were an astronaut,                           I would go to Mars.

           If I could live to be 150 years old,              I would know my great-great-grandchildren.
           If you could travel to the past,                  you could meet your ancestors.
           If we didn’t have advanced technology,            we wouldn’t be able to explore space.
           If you took better care of yourself,              you might live to be 100 years old.

           If my father had not met my mother,               I wouldn’t have been born.

              parents. They’ve lived longer than you, and you can learn from their experience.”


               WRITING TIP
               When writing several sentences about an unreal situation, it is important to use consistent verb forms for anything
               that is imaginary.
                 If I had the opportunity to travel to Mars, I would definitely accept. I wouldn't be afraid because I would trust my
                 equipment and the people I was working with. On Mars, I would stay in touch with my family as well as I could.
               If you write I will be afraid. . . . it suggests that the situation is real.


              PART 3  Write
              Read the prompts. Choose one and write one or more paragraphs about it.
              1.   What do you think would be the advantages or disadvantages of cloning human beings?
              2.   Write about an important decision you made in the past. What would your life be like if you
                 hadn’t made this decision?

           SENTENCES TYPES


           There are three basic sentences types: simple, compound, and complex.
           Simple sentences usually have one subject and one verb:
                       s          v
                  Students love textbooks.

           Simple sentences can have more than one subject and / or verb:
                     s         s    v
                  Children and adults like pizza.

           Compound sentences are usually made up of two simple sentences (independent clauses) with a connector
           (a coordination conjunction such as and, but, or, yet, so, and for):
                                            coord
                    s    v                   conj  s      v
                  They worked hard all semester, but they did not finish the project.

           Complex sentences have one independent clause and at least one dependent clause. The dependent clause is often
           an adverb clause, which begins with a connector (a subordinating conjunction such as while, although, because, and if):
                      sub
                     conj  dependent clause.                  independent clause

                  Although the test was very difficult, all the students received a passing grade.

              CONNECTORS


              COORDINATING CONJUNCTIONS
              Coordinating conjunctions join two independent clauses to form a compound sentence. Use a comma before a
              coordinating conjunction in a compound sentence.
                                           coord
                        independent clause    conj     independent clause

                     The exam was extremely difficult, but all of the students received a passing score.

              SUBORDINATING CONJUNCTIONS
              Subordinating conjunctions introduce a dependent clause in a complex sentence.
              When a dependent clause begins a sentence, use a comma to separate it from the independent clause.

                         dependent clause             independent clause

                     Although the exam was extremely difficult, all of the students received a passing score.

              When a dependent clause comes after an independent clause, no comma is used.

                           independent clause               dependent clause

                     All of the students received a passing score although the exam was extremely difficult.

              TRANSITION WORDS

              Transition words show the relationship between ideas in sentences.
              A transition followed by a comma can begin a sentence.
